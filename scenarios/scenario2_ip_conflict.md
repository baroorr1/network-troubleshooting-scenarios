### üß† Root Cause
Another device on the network was manually assigned the same static IP, creating a conflict.

### üîß Resolution

**Option 1: Switch to DHCP**
```bash
netsh interface ip set address "Wi-Fi" dhcp
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```

**Option 2: Use a different static IP**
```bash
netsh interface ip set address "Wi-Fi" static 192.168.1.55 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
```

**Verify the fix:**
```bash
ipconfig
ping 8.8.8.8
```
